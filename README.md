# üìò Project Brief: DSJ04 React Podcast Application

Hello, and thank you for reviewing this brief. I am currently developing a React-based podcast browsing application designed to deliver a refined and responsive user experience. The application will enable users to search, sort, filter, and paginate through a curated list of podcast shows, with all interactions synchronized in real time.

This project is intended to demonstrate proficiency in managing complex UI state, coordinating multiple user inputs, and maintaining a clean, scalable codebase. My objective is to build an intuitive interface that remains consistent across all navigation flows.

## üéØ Key Functional Requirements

### 1. Search Capability

- Users will be able to search for podcasts by any portion of the title.
- Search results will update dynamically as the user types or upon submission.
- The search function will integrate seamlessly with active filters, sorting preferences, and pagination state.

### 2. Sorting Mechanism

- Sorting options will include:
  - Newest first (based on last updated date).
  - Alphabetical order (A‚ÄìZ and Z‚ÄìA).
- Sorting will operate in conjunction with all other active controls.

### 3. Genre-Based Filtering

- A dropdown or multi-select input will allow users to filter podcasts by genre.
- Filters will persist across page navigation and remain compatible with search and sort functions.

### 4. Pagination System

- Podcasts will be displayed in manageable segments using pagination, load-more functionality, or infinite scroll.
- Pagination will respect all active search, filter, and sort parameters.
- UI selections will remain intact throughout navigation.

### 5. State Synchronization

- Application state will be centrally managed using React state, context, or a suitable state management library.
- All controls will reflect changes immediately and remain synchronized.

### 6. Code Quality and Documentation

- All major functions and modules will be documented using JSDoc.
- Consistent formatting and naming conventions will be applied throughout.
- Logic will be modular, and components will be reusable.

## üåê API Integration

Podcast data will be retrieved via the following endpoint:

[https://podcast-api.netlify.app](https://podcast-api.netlify.app) ‚Äî this returns an array of podcast previews.

**Note:** Genre information is provided only as IDs in the API response. Full genre titles will be mapped using the `data.js` file included in the repository.

## üì¶ Project Deliverables

- A fully functional React application that:

  - Fetches and displays podcast data.
  - Supports live search, sorting, filtering, and pagination.
  - Maintains consistent state across all user interactions.

- A clean and maintainable codebase featuring:

  - Modular, reusable components.
  - Consistent formatting and structure.
  - JSDoc documentation.

- A comprehensive `README.md` file containing:

  - Project overview and purpose.
  - Setup and usage instructions.
  - Descriptions of key features.

- Version control via GitHub with:
  - Clear, descriptive commit messages.
  - Incremental commits reflecting development progress.
